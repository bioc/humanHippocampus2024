### Introduction

Welcome to the `humanHippocampus2024` package! In this vignettes, we are going
to show how to access the spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and
single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from adjacent tissue sections of
the anterior human hippocampus across ten adult neurotypical donors generated
by Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD) researchers and collaborators.

### Motivation

The main purpose to create R/Bioconductor package was to access the SRT and
snRNA-seq data from `spatial_HPC` project via an open-source and public
interface such that the data can be referenced or analyzed in other projects
conveniently.

### Study Design

</figure>

Experimental design to generate paired single-nucleus RNA-sequencing
(snRNA-seq) and spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data in the human
hippocampus. (A) Postmortem human tissue blocks from the anterior hippocampus
were dissected from 10 adult neurotypical brain donors. Tissue blocks were
scored and cryosectioned for snRNA-seq assays (red), and placement on Visium
slides (Visium H&E, black; Visium Spatial Proteogenomics (SPG), yellow). (B)
10$\mu$m tissue sections from all ten donors were placed onto 2-5 capture areas
to include the extent of the HPC(n=36 total capture areas), for measurement
with the 10x Genomics Visium H&E platform. (C) 10$\mu$m tissue sections from
two donors were placed onto 4 capture areas (n=8 total capture areas) for
measurement with the 10x Genomics Visium-SPG platform. (D) Tissue sections (2-4
100$\mu$m cryosections per assay) from all ten donors were collected from the
same tissue blocks for measurement with the 10x Genomics 3â€™ gene expression
platform. For each donor, we sorted on both and PI+NeuN+ (n=26 total snRNA-seq
libraries). (This figure was created with
[Biorender](https://www.biorender.com/))

#### Data Access

All data, including raw FASTQ files and SpaceRanger/CellRanger processed data
outputs, can be accessed via Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accessions
[GSE264692](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE264692) (SRT)
and [GSE264624](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE264624)
(snRNA-seq).

All R scripts created to perform analyses can be found
[here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatial_hpc).

### Package Tutorial

#### Installation

`humanHippocampus2024` is an R package available via
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) repository for packages. GitHub
repository can be found
[here](https://github.com/christinehou11/humanHippocampus2024).

Bioconductor version of 3.20 on R version of 4.4 is required.

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("humanHippocampus2024")

## Check that you have a valid Bioconductor installation
BiocManager::valid()
```

The development version from GitHub can be obtained by:

```{r github, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}

remotes::install_github("christinehou11/humanHippocampus2024")
```
