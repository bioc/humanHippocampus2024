Description: This is an ExperimentHub package that helps to access the 
    spatially-resolved transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data.
    The datasets are generated from adjacent tissue sections of the anterior 
    human hippocampus across ten adult neurotypical donors. The datasets are
    based on [spatial_hpc](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatial_hpc) 
    project by Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD) researchers and 
    collaborators.
